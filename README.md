# Cuckoo_Malware_Analysis
This is the code repository for **Behavior Malware Classification** research. All the machine learning models are implemented using Python 3.9.13.

# Data

The source data consists of JSON reports generated by **CapeV2**, a dynamic analysis system derived from **Cuckoo v1**. These reports were analyzed to extract the most frequently used APIs in malicious samples. Through this analysis, 136 features were selected for classification purposes. The dataset comprises 230 labeled samples, with 115 benign and 115 malware samples. To avoid data imbalance issues, an equal number of benign and malware samples were used.

A preliminary analysis was conducted using a small subset of data to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection. Future analyses will involve a larger number of samples to further validate the findings.
